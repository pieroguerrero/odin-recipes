    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Peruvian ceviche</strong> is a traditional dish widely eaten in
        Peru. The method of preparing it is different to that of ceviche in other places, using lemon, fish, potatoes
        and other foods. In Peru, ceviche has been declared to be part of Peru's "national heritage" and has had a
        holiday declared in its honor.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
            <p>Place the sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced
                with a fork, then drain, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place the sliced onion in a bowl of
                warm water, let stand 10 minutes, then drain and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
            <p>Meanwhile, place the lime juice, celery, cilantro, and cumin into the bowl of a blender, and puree until
                smooth. Pour this mixture into a large glass bowl, and stir in the garlic and habanero pepper. Season
                with salt and pepper, then stir in the diced tilapia and shrimp.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
            <p>Set aside to marinate for an hour, stirring occasionally. The seafood is done once it turns firm and
                opaque.</p>

                bowls with lettuce leaves. Spoon the ceviche with its juice into the bowls and garnish with slices of
                sweet potato.</p>
