    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
            <p>Place chicken breasts, onion, carrot, and 2 cloves garlic in a large saucepan, pour in 2 quarts of water
                and slowly bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Skim off the foam which forms on top, then cover,
                reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken to a
                plate and allow to cool. Strain the resulting chicken stock, discarding the vegetables.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
            <p>Pour evaporated milk and 1/2 cup chicken stock into the bowl of a blender. Add bread cubes and puree
                until smooth. Add Parmesan cheese and walnuts; puree until smooth. Shred the cooled chicken and discard
                the bones.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
            <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in minced garlic and minced onion; cook
                until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in shredded chicken and aji
                amarillo until heated through. Pour in bread puree and cook until hot, stirring frequently. Add more
                chicken stock if needed to keep from getting too thick. Season with turmeric and simmer for 5 minutes
                more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
            <p>Serve garnished with hard-cooked egg slices and sprinkled with kalamata olives.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
